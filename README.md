# 📦 AI Email Support — Beta Branch

The `beta` branch contains a fully functional and stable implementation of the AI-powered email support service.

## 🆚 Differences from `main`

- ✅ Stable Docker build and deployment  
- ✅ Working integration with Gmail API and OAuth2  
- ✅ FAISS index and knowledge base load correctly  
- ✅ Ollama connected with `gemma:7b` and `all-minilm` models  
- ✅ Response generation based on email semantics  
- ✅ Logs processed in real-time  

## 🎯 Branch Goal

Preserve the current implementation as a reference and stable version before moving on to developing new features in `alpha`.

## 🚀 Next Branch: `alpha`

The `alpha` branch will focus on development of:  
- Prometheus monitoring  
- File-based logging  
- Knowledge base expansion  
- Web interface and REST API
